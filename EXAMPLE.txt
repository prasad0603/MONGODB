HOW TO CREATE DATABASE AND COLLECTIONS(MONGO DB)
1.This will create a new database named example. If a database named example already exists, it will start using it
command-use college

2.This will create a collection name students inside the college database.
command-db.createCollection("students")

3.This will print the list of collections in your current database.
command-show collections

4.The above command inserts the documents into the collection.
command for insert one Document-db.student.insertOne({name:"prasad",age:20,branch:"cst")}
command for insert two Documents-db.student.insertMany([{name:"Pavan sai",age:21,branch:"csd"},{name:"sowmya",age:23,branch:"csc"}])

5.This command gives you the number of documents in the collection.
command-db.student.count()

6.This command lists all the documents in the collection mycollection
command-db.student.find()
note:Notice that mongodb automatically adds an ‘_id’ field to every document in order to uniquely identify the document.

CRUED OPERATONS(MONGOBD)
R-READ
Let us try out different ways of querying documents.

1.Find the count of documents.
db.student.count()
2.List the first document in the collection.
db.student.findOne()
3.List all documents in the collection.
db.student.find()
4.List first 2 documents in the collection.
db.student.find().limit(3)
5.view have to view branch cst in your collecions
db.student.find({branch:"cst")
